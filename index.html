          <h3>Problem : Dandruff</h3>
          <h4>Solution:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use peppermint or mint-based shampoos. Apply shampoo on scalp,
              massage in circular motion and then pat on mid hair lenghts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Home Remedy:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In case of sticky dandruff, hot oil therapy is useful.</li>
            <li>Heat pure coconut, sesame seed or olive oil.</li>
            <li>
              Apply on scalp with cotton wool, rubbing gently to dislodge the
              flakes.
            </li>

        <h2>Essential Oils</h2>
        <p>

          that are both beneficial for both beauty and health. Made from the
          essence of different plants and herbs, these oils are widely used in
          aromatherapy and naturopathy.

          aroma compounds from plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essential oils are carrier oils and can't be used directly on the

          lotions and hair oils or even water.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than 3 to 4 drops or these oils may cause irritation and other
          skin problems. The best part is that essential oils can be used
          throughout the year irrespective of the season and on all skin types.
